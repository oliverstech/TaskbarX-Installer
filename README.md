# TaskbarX Installer
A simple installer for TaskbarX

[![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/oliverstech/TaskbarX-Installer/total?style=flat-square)]([releases/latest](https://github.com/oliverstech/TaskbarX-Installer/releases/latest))

I decided to make this as TaskbarX doesn't actually have an official installer. It took me 10 minutes with Inno Setup.

You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/oliverstech/TaskbarX-Installer/releases/latest).

Enjoy!
